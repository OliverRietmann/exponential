\section*{Logarithmic Scale}
Figure~\ref{fig:casesCH} shows the number of infections in Switzerland per day from September to November 2020.
As we are going to see, this is already an example of \textit{exponential growth}.
\begin{figure}[ht]

\end{figure}
Looking at the figure, we see that from day 12 to day 36, the number of infections is doubling every 6 days.
